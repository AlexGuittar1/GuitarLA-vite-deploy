# Guitar Store Project

This is a project built using Vite and React. The main functionality of this application is a guitar store, where users can browse and add various guitars to their shopping cart. The user can add up to a maximum of 5 guitars to the cart and can also completely remove any item from it. The cart dynamically updates the total price based on the user's modifications.

For this, a simple JavaScript-based database is implemented. This database does not require an API and is not built professionally, but it serves its purpose for the scope of this project. Hooks are utilized, including event handling, and state management with `useState` and `useEffect` is implemented to handle the dynamic behavior of the application.

This project serves as a practice exercise for learning React. If you find any issues or improvements, feel free to contribute by creating a fork and copying the project locally.
